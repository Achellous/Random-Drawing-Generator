# Random Drawing Generator

## Overview

The Random Drawing Generator is a Java application that allows you to create and visualize random geometric shapes. The project utilizes Java's Swing library for GUI components and includes various shape classes such as Circle, Triangle, Square, and Line.

## Features

- **Random Shape Generation:** Create random instances of circles, triangles, squares, and lines with the click of a button.
- **Drawing Display:** Visualize the generated shapes in a Swing-based drawing panel.
- **Simple GUI:** The application features an easy-to-use graphical user interface.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE.
3. Run the `Drawing` class to launch the application.
4. Use the buttons to generate and display random shapes.

## Project Structure

- **Kunstwerk:** An abstract class representing a generic artwork with a fill color. Other shape classes inherit from this class.
- **Circle, Triangle, Square, Line:** Concrete shape classes extending the Kunstwerk class, each with a method to create a random instance.
- **Drawing:** The main class handling the GUI and shape generation.

## Requirements

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher.

## Acknowledgments
